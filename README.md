# Document Processing and Chatbot Interaction Pipeline

## Overview

The Document Processing and Chatbot Interaction Pipeline is an innovative project that leverages advanced technologies such as language models, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and chatbot frameworks to intelligently process documents, extract essential information, and enable user interaction through a chatbot interface. The pipeline is capable of handling various document formats, including PDFs containing both text and image content, and adapts to different information extraction tasks.

## Key Components

- **Language Model (LLM):** Utilizes advanced language models for understanding and processing text data.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** Employs OCR technology to extract text from images within documents.
- **Langchain:** Framework for language processing and text analytics.
- **Ollama:** Toolkit for information extraction and document analysis.
- **Chatbase:** Chatbot analytics platform for tracking user interactions and improving chatbot performance.

## Features

- **Document Processing:** Analyzes documents, including invoice/receipt type PDFs, to extract essential information such as key-value pairs.
- **OCR Integration:** Handles scenarios where OCR is required to extract text from images within documents.
- **Chatbot Interaction:** Enables user interaction through a chatbot interface for querying extracted information and performing related tasks.
- **Adaptability:** Adapts to different document formats and information extraction tasks, ensuring robust performance across various use cases.
